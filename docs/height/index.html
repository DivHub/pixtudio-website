<a href=category:librender>category:librender</a></p><p><a href=Local_variables title=wikilink><strong>Up to Local Variables</strong></a></p><hr><h2 id=definition>Definition</h2><p>The predefined local variable height is used in
<a href=Mode7 title=wikilink>Mode7</a> windows, and it is assigned to each process.
It is therefore only relevant in the coordinate system of mode7
(<a href=Ctype title=wikilink>Ctype</a>=<a href=C_M7 title=wikilink>C_M7</a>). It is used to
define the height of the process graphics in relation to the semi-3d
field. This is not to be confused with the local variable
<a href=Z title=wikilink>Z</a>, as that is used to control the depth of the graphical
layers.</p><p>The height is normally a positive number, because the height of the
bottom is 0, and all the processes are placed above it. When the height
variable is not defined, it is 0 by default. The graphic base is placed
at the indicated height, with the exception when
<a href=controlpoint title=wikilink>controlpoint</a> number 0 is changed (the default
is overruled by the <a href=Center_set title=wikilink>Center_set</a>() function). In
that case, the controlpoint will be placed at that height.</p>
