Here's a list of constant categories used in Bennu. When you're using an older version of Bennu and it doesn't recognize the constant, just use the corresponding value, which is listed with the constant.

This is not guarenteed to work, because functionality could have been added in a later version than you are using. It is advised to always use the latest version of Bennu.
